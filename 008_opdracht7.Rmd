# Working with DBeaver and SQL

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dslabs)
library(here)
```

First, I read in the flu, dengue and gapminder data.
<br>
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
flu <- read_csv(here("data/flu_data.csv"), skip = 11)
dengue <- read_csv(here("data/dengue_data.csv"), skip = 11)
gapminder <- read_builtin("gapminder")
```

The flu and dengue data wasn't tidy yet, so I solved that by ..
The gapminder data was tidy already, so I didn't change anything about that.
<br>
```{r}

```
