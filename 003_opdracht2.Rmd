# Cleaning up according to the Guerrilla analytics framework

This was the third assignment for our portfolio. We had to apply the Guerrilla analytics framework to our DAUR2 folder.

```{r setup3, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# install.packages("fs")
library(fs)
library(here)
```

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = here("Daur2"), type = "directory")
```
