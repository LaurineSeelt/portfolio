  abstract = {The Langendorff’s isolated perfused small mammalian heart represents the optimal compromise in the conflict between the quantity and quality of data that can be acquired from an experimental model versus its clinical relevance, especially in relation to ischemia-reperfusion injury. We analyzed the important recent, as well as standard older articles to highlight the importance of Langendorff’s isolated heart technique using the rat as an experimental animal model. The retrograde perfusion of isolated rat heart preparation is the most commonly used technique in cardiovascular research experiments with many advantages. The longevity of this preparation is one of the main advantages. From the moment an ex vivo preparation is established, it starts to deteriorate and the rate will depend on number of factors such as the skill of the operator, the species of animal, age, initial heart rate, choice and composition of the perfusion fluid, flow rate, presence or absence of various drugs, preload pressure, and the temperature at which the studies are carried out. Recently, various techniques and variables measured have undergone modifications. This review article has attempted to address many of the issues, developments, and applications which will assist investigators to make the best possible use of this experimental model using the rat.},
