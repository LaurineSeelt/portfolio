  abstract = {The Langendorff’s isolated perfused small mammalian heart represents the optimal compromise in the conflict between the quantity and quality of data that can be acquired from an experimental model versus its clinical relevance, especially in relation to ischemia-reperfusion injury. We analyzed the important recent, as well as standard older articles to highlight the importance of Langendorff’s isolated heart technique using the rat as an experimental animal model. The retrograde perfusion of isolated rat heart preparation is the most commonly used technique in cardiovascular research experiments with many advantages. The longevity of this preparation is one of the main advantages. From the moment an ex vivo preparation is established, it starts to deteriorate and the rate will depend on number of factors such as the skill of the operator, the species of animal, age, initial heart rate, choice and composition of the perfusion fluid, flow rate, presence or absence of various drugs, preload pressure, and the temperature at which the studies are carried out. Recently, various techniques and variables measured have undergone modifications. This review article has attempted to address many of the issues, developments, and applications which will assist investigators to make the best possible use of this experimental model using the rat.},

  abstract = {Oscar Langendorff introduced the first method for isolating a heart with contractile activity in 1895. Since then, the Langendorff method has remained a powerful technique in cardiac research and has led to major advances in medicine. The primary goal of the Langendorff method is to provide an isolated heart with oxygen and metabolites via a cannula inserted into the aorta. The Langendorff heart is a complex in vitro technique used primarily in pharmacological and physiological research that allows the evaluation of multiple cardiac hemodynamic parameters including, but not limited to, contractility and heart rate. This article will first provide a brief background of the Langendorff method as well as details regarding organ isolation. Finally, the article will discuss the benefits of a new technique for hanging the isolated heart aorta and the benefits of this technique over traditional methods © 2017 The Author.
