[["parameterization.html", "11 Parameterization", " 11 Parameterization To show that I can work with parameterization in my Markdowns, I made a parameterized markdown with data about COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths. The data used for this markdown was from the ECDC website. To start, I downloaded this data from the website and read it in in RStudio. covid19_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;Data/Data_raw/covid19_data.csv&quot;)) Then, I stored the three parameters as objects so I can use them in the title of my figures. I also changed the value ‘month’ to a numeric variable, so it’d be easier to use later on in the graphs. covid19_data &lt;- covid19_data %&gt;% mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) country &lt;- params$country year &lt;- params$year months &lt;- params$month # covid19_data_filtered &lt;- covid19_data %&gt;% filter(year %in% params$year, month %in% params$month, countriesAndTerritories %in% params$country) I created a graph to show the COVID-19 cases per day for a specific month, and I also created a graph for the amount of COVID-19 related deaths per day for a specific month. covid19_data %&gt;% group_by(day, month, year) %&gt;% filter(countriesAndTerritories == params$country &amp; year == params$year &amp; month == params$month) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = day, y = cases)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 31, 1)) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;COVID-19 cases in &quot;, country, &quot;, &quot;, months, &quot; &quot;, year), x = &quot;Day&quot;, y = &quot;COVID-19 cases&quot;) covid19_data %&gt;% group_by(day, month, year) %&gt;% filter(countriesAndTerritories == params$country &amp; year == params$year &amp; month == params$month) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = day, y = deaths)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 31, 1)) + labs(title = paste0(&quot;COVID-19 related deaths in &quot;, country, &quot;, &quot;, months, &quot; &quot;, year), x = &quot;Day&quot; , y = &quot;COVID-19 related deaths&quot;) I made three HTML’s with rmarkdown::render() in R.
