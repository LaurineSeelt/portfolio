[["cleaning-up.html", "4 Cleaning up", " 4 Cleaning up To show that I know how apply the Guerrilla analytics framework to my own folders, I applied this framework to my ‘DAUR2’ folder. I decided to: 1. Make a folder called “Rmd” in which I keep all of my markdowns. 2. Make a folder called “Data” in which I store all the data I’ve used. This folder is split in “Metagenomics” and “RNA_seq”, to separate the two analyses I’ve conducted during Daur2. Both those folders contain the sub folder “Data_raw”, which is data I cannot touch. This is the raw data I received from teachers or downloaded from the internet. For Metagenomics, I made two extra folders called “Mock1” and “Mock2”, to separate the two data sets I investigated. 3. Make a folder called “R”. In this folder, I store functions I’ve written. 4. Make a folder called “Code”. This folder contains the scripts I’ve written, except my Rmarkdowns. fs::dir_tree(path = here(&quot;Daur2&quot;), type = &quot;directory&quot;) ## C:/Users/lautj/Documents/DSFB2/portfolio/Daur2 ## ├── Code ## ├── Data ## │ ├── Metagenomics ## │ │ ├── Data_raw ## │ │ ├── Mock1 ## │ │ ├── Mock2 ## │ │ └── Supporting ## │ └── RNA_seq ## │ └── Data_raw ## ├── R ## └── Rmd "]]
